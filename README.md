# superlexis

SICSS 2024 team working on LexisNexis data

## This Github consists of

*Parser.py* (to organize and structure the LexisNexis data) *Processing* (how to prepare the text ready for analysis) *Communicating* (slides for the presentation) This is difficult.

## Problem notebook 

-   Difficult to narrow down the topic (the problem of overabundance)

    -   We ended up going with cycling.

    -   6 countries and 2 newspaper, but we faced rate limits so went to 4 countries with relevance

-   Difficult to parse LexisNexis to a usable dataframe
